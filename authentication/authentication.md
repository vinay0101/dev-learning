# üõ°Ô∏è Modern API Authentication: A Complete Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of API authentication, focusing on **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**, the **Access/Refresh Token strategy**, and security best practices.

-----

## 1. üîë Core Authentication Concepts

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a client (a user or another server) that is trying to access your API.

### Common Methods

  * **Session-Based:** The server creates a session, stores its data, and gives the client a Session ID (usually in a cookie). (Used in traditional web apps)
  * **JWT (Token-Based):** The server issues a signed, self-contained token that the client sends with each request. (Used in SPAs, mobile apps)
  * **API Keys:** A simple secret key passed in a request header. (Used for server-to-server communication)
  * **OAuth 2.0:** A delegation protocol for granting third-party applications limited access. (Used for "Login with Google/Facebook")

### Stateful vs. Stateless Patterns

  * **Stateful:** The server **maintains the state** or data of a user's session (e.g., in a database or cache). Session-based auth is stateful.
  * **Stateless:** The server **does not store any session state**. Each request from the client contains all the information needed to authenticate and process it. JWTs enable stateless authentication and are ideal for distributed systems where you don't want to centralize session storage.

-----

## 2. üíé JWT (JSON Web Token) Deep Dive

A JWT is a compact, URL-safe string that represents "claims" between two parties. It's the most popular way to build stateless authentication.

  * **Key Feature:** The server doesn't need to store session data. The token itself is the proof of identity.
  * **What it is:** A JSON object containing data, which is secured with a cryptographic signature.

### JWT Structure: `Header.Payload.Signature`

A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (`.`):

`eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c`

1.  **Header:** Contains metadata, like the token type (`JWT`) and the signing algorithm used.
    ```json
    {
      "alg": "HS256",
      "typ": "JWT"
    }
    ```
2.  **Payload:** Contains the "claims" (the data). These are statements about the user and additional data.
    ```json
    {
      "sub": "1234567890", // Subject (who the token is about, e.g., user ID)
      "name": "John Doe",
      "iat": 1516239022   // Issued At (timestamp)
      "exp": 1516240022   // Expiration (timestamp)
    }
    ```
3.  **Signature:** This is what provides the security. It's created using the header, payload, and a secret key.
    ```
    signature = HMACSHA256(
      Base64URL(header) + "." + Base64URL(payload),
      your_secret_key
    )
    ```

> **Warning: A JWT's payload is Base64URL-encoded, *not* encrypted!**
> Anyone can decode the payload and read its contents. The signature's only job is to **guarantee that the data hasn't been tampered with**.
> 
> **NEVER put highly sensitive data (like passwords) in a JWT payload.**

### Visual: JWT Assembly & Verification (Mermaid)

    JWT -->|split| HB2
    JWT -->|split| PB2
    JWT -->|split| Sig2
    HB2 & PB2 --> Verify[Verify Signature with secret/public key]
  end
```

### Signing Methods

  * **HMAC (Symmetric):** Uses **one secret key** to both sign and verify the token. Fast and simple.
  * **RSA / ECDSA (Asymmetric):** Uses a **private key** to sign and a **public key** to verify. More complex, but allows third-party services to verify a token without having access to the secret key ‚Äî ideal for distributed verification.

## 3. üì¶ How to Store Tokens on the Client

Once a user logs in, the server sends them a JWT. The client must store it and send it back with every future request. There are two main ways to do this:

| Method | Description | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **JWT in Cookie** | Server sets the token in an `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookie. The browser auto-sends it with each request. | ‚úÖ **Safer from XSS** (JavaScript can't read it).<br>‚úÖ Easy session handling for browsers. | ‚ùå Vulnerable to CSRF if not configured with `SameSite` / CSRF protection. |
| **JWT in Response (JSON)**| Token is sent in the response body. Client stores it (e.g., `localStorage`) and manually adds it in the `Authorization` header. | ‚úÖ **Works for all clients** (APIs, mobile).<br>‚úÖ Fine-grained control in SPA. | ‚ùå Vulnerable to XSS if stored in `localStorage` / accessible JS. |

> ### üí° Rule of Thumb
>
>   * **For browser-based web apps:** Use **Cookies** with the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` attributes. This provides the best all-around protection against both XSS and CSRF.
>   * **For mobile apps or third-party APIs:** Use the **Authorization Header** method.

## 4. üîÑ The Access Token + Refresh Token Strategy

A single, long-lived JWT is a huge security risk. If it's stolen, an attacker has access until it expires. The standard solution is to use **two** tokens.

  * **Access Token:** A short-lived JWT (e.g., **5-15 minutes**). It's sent with every API request to access protected resources.
  * **Refresh Token:** A long-lived, opaque token (e.g., **7-30 days**). Its *only* job is to get a new access token when the old one expires.

### Why You *Must* Store Refresh Tokens (Server-Side)

Refresh tokens are highly sensitive and **must be stored statefully on the server** (e.g., in your database or a Redis cache).

#### üëé What Happens Without Storing Them?

  * **No Revocation:** If a refresh token is stolen, an attacker can generate new access tokens indefinitely. You have no way to "turn off" that token.
  * **No Control:** You can't log a user out of all devices or invalidate their session if you detect a threat.

#### üëç What Storing Them Allows You to Do:

  * ‚úÖ **Invalidate Sessions:** When a user logs out, you **delete their refresh token** from your database. Their session is now fully dead.
  * ‚úÖ **Detect Threats:** You can block a specific refresh token if you detect suspicious activity (like a sudden IP address change).
  * ‚úÖ **Manage Devices:** You can store one token per device, allowing a user to "log out of all other devices."

### Visual: Access + Refresh Flow (Mermaid)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User/Client
  participant AS as Auth Server
  participant API as Resource Server

  U->>AS: POST /login (credentials)
  AS-->>U: access_token (short) + refresh_token (long)

  U->>API: GET /resource (Authorization: Bearer access_token)
  API->>AS: Validate access_token (signature + exp)
  alt access_token valid
    API-->>U: 200 OK (resource)
  else access_token expired
    U->>AS: POST /refresh (refresh_token)
    AS-->>U: new access_token
    U->>API: GET /resource (new access_token)
    API-->>U: 200 OK
  end
```

### How to Store Refresh Tokens

Store them securely, just like passwords. **Always hash the refresh token** in your database.

**Storage Options:**

| Method | Description | Common Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **In-memory (array)** | Simple for demos; resets on server restart. | Dev / Testing |
| **Database Table** | Persisted; tokens are tied to user IDs. | Standard Web Apps |
| **Redis Cache** | Very fast in-memory store, can set TTL to auto-expire. | Scalable APIs |

**Example DB Table (`user_refresh_tokens`):**

| user\_id | refresh\_token\_hash | expires\_at | device | created\_at |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `sha256(xyz123...)` | 2025-11-06 | `Chrome` | 2025-10-30 |
| 1 | `sha256(abc987...)` | 2025-11-08 | `iOS App` | 2025-10-31 |
| 2 | `sha256(def456...)` | 2025-11-07 | `Chrome` | 2025-10-30 |

## 5. üóëÔ∏è How to Invalidate an Access Token

This is the classic "problem" with stateless JWTs. Because the server *doesn't* check a database, **an access token is valid until it expires.** You cannot "unsend" it.

If a user logs out, their 15-minute access token is still technically valid until it expires.

### Method 1: Short Expiry + Refresh Tokens (The Standard)

‚è≥ **Make access tokens expire very quickly (e.g., 5‚Äì15 minutes).**

This is the most common and simplest solution. If an access token is compromised, the window of vulnerability is tiny. As soon as the user logs out, their *refresh token* is revoked, so the attacker can't obtain new access tokens.

### Method 2: Blacklist / Token Revocation List (The Stateful Fix)

üóÇÔ∏è **Maintain a server-side blacklist of "bad" access tokens.**

This adds state back into your stateless system, but is necessary for high-security environments.

  * **How it works:** When a user logs out, you add their token's ID (a `jti` or "JWT ID" claim) to a list in Redis.
  * **On every API request, the server must:**
    1.  Verify the token's signature. ‚úÖ
    2.  Check if the token's `jti` is in the blacklist. ‚ùå
  * **Trade-off:** This adds a database/cache lookup to *every single request*, partially defeating the performance benefit of JWTs.

### Visual: Token Revocation (Simple ASCII / Flow)

```
[User logs out] -> [Server adds jti to blacklist in Redis]
[Incoming Request] -> [Verify signature] -> [Check blacklist]
     if jti in blacklist -> reject
     else -> accept until expiry
```
